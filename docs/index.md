polCAM is a MATLAB application that can be used to process, analyse and display polarisation camera image data. It can be used to analyse single-molecule orientation lcoalisation microscopy (SMOLM) data as well as diffraction limited image data.

It requires a MATLAB installation (tested with version R_2021b) and an active MATLAB license. The following toolboxes are required: ... . The following toolboxes are optional: Parallel processing toolbox.

# Installation

Download the latest version and double click the file `polCAM.mlappinstall`. Follow the MATLAB app installation instructions. If installation is successful, a new icon should pop up under the 'APPS' tab in MATLAB.

## Structure

## Loading data

### Loading a single stack
Image data (as a .tif stack) can be loaded from the menu `File>Open stack...`. Once loaded, a new window will pop up displaying the first frame of the stack. The arrow keys (or the `<` and `>` buttons on the gui) can be used to scroll through the stack.

### Loading a sequence of stacks
When acquiring large datasets in Micro-manager, the acquisition will automatically be written away as multiple stacks. For example:
- asyn_fibril_NR_1_MMStacks_Default.ome.tif
- asyn_fibril_NR_2_MMStacks_Default.ome.tif
- asyn_fibril_NR_3_MMStacks_Default.ome.tif
- etc.
In this case, the whole sequence can be loaded using `File>Open stack sequence...`. Navigate to the folder containing the stacks and enter the basename when prompted. In the example above, the basename would be 'asyn_fibril_NR_'. 

### Loading a localisation file
You can load a localisation file that was previously generated by the software from the menu `File>Load localisations...`. You can then perform further processing (e.g. filtering) and/or analysis.

## Processing
polCAM can be used to process both single-molecule orientation localisation microscopy (SMOLM) data and diffraction-limited polarisation microscopy data. All processing options can respectively be accessed from the menu item `Process>Single-molecule...` and `Process>Diffraction-limited...`.
