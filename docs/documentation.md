Watch a [video tutorial](https://ezrabru.github.io/polCAM/) to get an overview of the software or refer to the documentation:

## Structure


## Loading data


**Loading a single stack:** 
Image data (as a .tif stack) can be loaded from the menu `File>Open stack...`. Once loaded, a new window will pop up displaying the first frame of the stack. The arrow keys (or the `<` and `>` buttons on the gui) can be used to scroll through the stack.

**Loading a sequence of stacks:** 
When acquiring large datasets in Micro-manager, the acquisition will automatically be written away as multiple stacks. For example:
- asyn_fibril_NR_1_MMStacks_Default.ome.tif
- asyn_fibril_NR_2_MMStacks_Default.ome.tif
- asyn_fibril_NR_3_MMStacks_Default.ome.tif
- etc.
In this case, the whole sequence can be loaded using `File>Open stack sequence...`. Navigate to the folder containing the stacks and enter the basename when prompted. In the example above, the basename would be 'asyn_fibril_NR_'. 

**Loading a localisation file:** 
You can load a localisation file that was previously generated by the software from the menu `File>Load localisations...`. You can then perform further processing (e.g. filtering) and/or analysis.


## Processing
polCAM can be used to process both single-molecule orientation localisation microscopy (SMOLM) data and diffraction-limited polarisation microscopy data. All processing options can respectively be accessed from the menu item `Process>Single-molecule...` and `Process>Diffraction-limited...`.
